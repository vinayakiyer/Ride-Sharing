# Ride Sharing
 Contains part of the code written jointly with Motaz Al-Chanati for our paper titled "What Drives the Efficiency Gains in Ridesharing Markets? : Evidence from Austin". There are 2 python scripts here :
 
 1. **create_border_discontinuity.py** -  Constructs a dataset for implementing a border discontinuity to estimate the price elasticity of demand
 2. **gen_counterfactual_graphs.py** -  Generates graphs using data which we generate from counterfactual simulations
 
 
 ## Notes : 
 1. The raw data used an input for **create_border_discontinuity.py** and the data from the simulation used in **gen_counterfactual_graphs.py** are available upon request
 2. The Julia code for estimating our model to generate the counterfactual data as well as a draft of the paper are also available upon request.
